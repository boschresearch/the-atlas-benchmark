# The Atlas Benchmark

The Atlas Benchmark offers a collection of scripts and functions for evaluating 2D trajectory predictors.

Atlas allows automated systematic evaluation and comparison of the built-in, external and new prediction methods on several popular datasets (ETH, ATC and THÃ–R) using probabilistic and geometric accuracy metrics (ADE, FDE, k-ADE and FDE, NLP).

Important highlights of Atlas include:

1. Supported import of new datasets (labeled detection streams),

2. Support for contextual cues in the environment,

3. Automated calibration of prediction hyperparameters,

4. Automated parametrized scenario extraction, 

5. Direct interface to the prediction methods.

# Installation and setup

```
git clone -b bare-bones https://github.com/boschresearch/the-atlas-benchmark.git
cd the-atlas-benchmark
git submodule add https://gitsvn-nt.oru.se/tim/the-atlas-benchmark-data.git dataset
python3 -m venv atlas-env
source atlas-env/bin/activate
sudo apt install python3-sklearn swig
pip install -r requirements.txt
python tests/unittests.py
code .
```
Try the notebooks `understanding_data_import.ipynb` and `understanding_prediction.ipynb`

If both notebooks work without issues, the Atlas Benchmark is ready to go.

# How to use it

The functionality of Atlas is fully described and illustrated in [docs/tutorial.md](docs/tutorial.md)

For a quick intro, head over to the `demo/` folder and check out the tutorial notebooks:
```
